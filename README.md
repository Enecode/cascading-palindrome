# Cascading Palindrome Finder

This script defines a class `CascadingPalindrome` that helps you find the longest cascading palindrome within a given input string. A cascading palindrome is a sequence of words that forms a palindrome when read consecutively.

## How It Works

The `CascadingPalindrome` class contains methods to check for palindromes and find the longest cascading palindrome in an input string. The `main()` function is the entry point of the script, which takes user input, validates it, and then displays the result.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing it in a Python environment:

```sh
python cascading_palindrome.py
```

## Example 1

```sh
$ python cascading_palindrome.py
Enter the input string: racecar wow anna sees radar
The cascading palindrome is: racecar wow anna sees

```

## Example 2

```sh
$ python cascading_palindrome.py
Enter the input string: hello world python cascading
There is no cascading palindrome in the input string.
```
